            <h2>Description</h2>
                <a>These enchiladas suizas 
                    are filled with chicken 
                    and cheese and have a nice bite, 
                    thanks to a creamy homemade salsa 
                    verde. 
                    They are equally delicious whether
                     you make them with cooked pork or beef.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        12 corn tortillas
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3 tablespoons canola oil for frying,
                         or as needed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2 cups shredded, cooked chicken breast meat
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Make the salsa verde: Melt butter 
                        in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and 
                        saut√© until soft, about 5 minutes. Add 
                        flour and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
                         Pour in broth, then add green chiles, garlic, 
                         salt, and cumin. Simmer until flavors have 
                         blended, about 15 minutes. Remove from the 
                         heat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make the enchiladas: Mix Monterrey Jack and Cheddar
                        together in a bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. 
                        Fry tortillas, one at a time, until blistering but still 
                        soft enough to roll, 10 to 20 seconds per side. Drain on 
                        paper towels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until sauce 
                        is bubbly and cheese is melted, about 20 minutes. 
                        Remove from the oven and garnish with olives and 
                        cherry tomatoes. Serve immediately with remaining 
                        salsa verde on the side.
                    </li>
